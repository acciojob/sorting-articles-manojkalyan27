function strip(bandName){
    
    // return bandName.replace(/^(a |an |the )/i, '').trim();

//     is a regular expression that does the following:

// Regex pattern: /^(a |an |the )/i

// ^ ensures that we match the articles only if they appear at the beginning of bandName.
// (a |an |the ) matches any of the words "a," "an," or "the" followed by a space.
// /i makes the regex case-insensitive, so it will match "The," "the," "A," "a," etc.
// Replace function: .replace(...)

// This function replaces the matched article (if found) with an empty string '', effectively removing it.
// Trim function: .trim()

// After removing the article, .trim() removes any extra spaces at the beginning or end of the string to keep it clean.
return bandName.replace(/^(a |an |the )/i , '').trim();

const sortedBands = bands.sort((a,b) => strip(a).localeCompare(strip(b)));


// The expression stripArticle(a).localeCompare(stripArticle(b)) is used to compare two band names, a and b, after removing any leading articles ("a," "an," or "the") from them. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each part:

// stripArticle(a) and stripArticle(b):

// These calls use the stripArticle function to remove the leading articles from the band names.
// For example, if a = "The Plot in You", then stripArticle(a) would return "Plot in You" (removing "The ").
// localeCompare():

// localeCompare() is a JavaScript method for comparing two strings in a way that respects language-specific rules (for sorting alphabetically).
// It returns:
// -1 if the first string should appear before the second in the sorted order,
// 1 if the first string should appear after the second, and
// 0 if the two strings are equivalent in terms of order.
// How localeCompare() is used here:

// stripArticle(a).localeCompare(stripArticle(b)) compares the two cleaned-up band names.
// By returning -1, 0, or 1, it instructs sort on how to position a relative to b in the sorted array.
